# WarframeDPS
Simulations of dps

A separate file with functions that calculate dps will be used in combination with others and it's going to have to be downloaded and put in the same folder as the main file (desired weapon). To achieve more precise ttk it's recommended to do an actual simulation, calculate ttk a lot of times (eg. 10000) and then take an average of them. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, I will be happy to help. :)
